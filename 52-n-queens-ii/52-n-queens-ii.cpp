// We first create a ( n X n ) chess board and assign 0 to every index.
// Whenever a queen will be placed, index will be made 1.

// In this approach ,

// Whenever a queen is placed, at first it is checked if it satisfies the conditions given that it is not under attack.

// validMove function.
// First it check there are no other queen in row the queen is filled.
// As we are putting queen column wise so no need to check for column.
// Then there are two diagonals to check for.

// COLUMN_WISE FILLING = Only left part of the diagonals are checked as positions to the right of the present column are still unfilled.
// ROW_WISE FILLING = Only upper part of the diagonals are checked as positions below of the present column are still unfilled.
// If conditions satisfied, Queen is placed and we move to next column.
// If no queen satisfy the problem, we backtrack and try to change the position of previous queen.
